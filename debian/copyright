Comment: Reasons for file exclusions
 - eval-okay-fromjson.nix contains an example from an RFC file
   see https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/3391
 - scripts/install-multi-user.sh is sourced from many places. Also the other
   install scripts are not needed in a Debian package.
 - exclude bundled dependency json.hpp (package nlohmann-json3-dev)
 - exclude bundled dependency highlight.js
 - exclude bundled dependency toml11
Files-Excluded:
 tests/lang/eval-okay-fromjson.*
 scripts/create-darwin-volume.sh
 scripts/install-darwin-multi-user.sh
 scripts/install-multi-user.sh
 scripts/install-nix-from-closure.sh

Comment: The upstream code is ambiguous about whether the license is
 LGPL-2.1 or LGPL-2.1+, see https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/3390.
 README.md says: "Nix is released under the LGPL v2.1".
 nix.spec.in and about-nix.xml say "LGPL 2.1+".
 Thus leaving the more conservative choice here until upstream resolves
 this.
